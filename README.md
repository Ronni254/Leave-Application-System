The project code is written in PHP, styling done using CSS and of course some javascript too.
The folders are self descriptive and so are the files therein. Most parts of the code is commented for readability and easy understanding.
I've not included the database file intentionally. Anyone interested in the code should create there own database and edit the DB_connection file to fit the names used.
<!-----------------------Inside The System--------------------------->

First of all, check out the basic php opening and closing tag: 
<?php
// PHP code goes here
?>

There are Two panels i.e Admin panel and User panel and therefore there must be  APIs connecting the two to the same database i.e _POST ad _GET.
On the user's side as well as the Admin's panel, the sections are named same to the name of the files bearing the codes.
